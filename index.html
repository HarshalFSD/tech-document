            <h2>Web Developer</h2>
            <p>Front-end web development, or client-side development, refers to working with HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or web application that allows users to see and interact with them directly</p>
            <h2>What a Front End Developer Does: An Overview</h2>
            <p>A front end developer has one general responsibility: to ensure that website visitors can easily interact with the page. They do this through the combination of design, technology and programming to code a website’s appearance, as well as taking care of debugging. Whenever you visit a website, anything that you see, click on or otherwise use is the work of a front end developer.</p>
            <h2>Common Tasks of a Front End Developer</h2>
            <p>Although there is some variation across companies, you can generally expect a front end developer role to include some or all of the following: 
            <ul>
                <li>Optimizing the user experience.</li>
                <li>Using HTML, JavaScript and CSS to bring concepts to life.</li>
                <li>Developing and maintaining the user interface.</li>
                <li>Implementing design on mobile websites.</li>
                <li>Creating tools that improve site interaction regardless of the browser.</li>
                <li>Managing software workflow.</li>
                <li>Following SEO best practices.</li>
                <li>Fixing bugs and testing for usability.</li>
            </ul> 
                </p>

            <h2>HTML basics</h2>
            <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.</p>
            <h2>what is HTML?</h2>
            <p>HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.  For example, take the following line of content: <code>My cat is very grumpy</code> If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags: <code>My cat is very grumpy</code></p>
            <h3>Anatomy of an HTML element</h3>
            <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.</li>
                <li>The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.</li>
                <li>The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.</li>
                <li>The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.</li>
            </ol>
                <p>for example:<pre><code>
                    
                    < !DOCTYPE html >
                    < html >
                    < body >
                    < h1 >My First Heading< /h1 >
                    < p >My first paragraph.< /p >
                    
                    < /body >
                    < /html >
                </code></pre></p>
                    <h4>Output</h4>
                    <samp>
                        <h1>My First Heading</h1>
                        <p>My first paragraph.</p>
                    </samp>
            <h2>CSS</h2>
            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
            <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting</p>
            <h2>What is CSS</h2>
            <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colours, layout, and fonts, thus making our web pages presentable to the users.

                CSS is designed to make style sheets for the web. It is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language. Now let’s try to break the acronym:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cascading: Falling of Styles</li>
                <li>Style: Adding designs/Styling our HTML tags</li>
                <li> Sheets: Writing our style in different documents</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="main-section" id="JavaScript">
            <header>JavaScript</header>
            <p>JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language. It is designed for creating network-centric applications. It is complimentary to and integrated with Java. JavaScript is very easy to implement because it is integrated with HTML. It is open and cross-platform</p>
            <h2>What is JavaScript ?</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.</p>
            <p>JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java. JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name LiveScript. The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.</p>
            <p>The ECMA-262 Specification defined a standard version of the core JavaScript language.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language.</li>
                <li>Designed for creating network-centric applications.</li>
                <li>Complementary to and integrated with Java</li>
                <li>Complementary to and integrated with HTML.</li>

        <section class="main-section" id="Bootstrap">
            <header>Bootstrap</header>
            <p>Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS- and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.</p>
            <p>As of August 2021, Bootstrap is the tenth most starred project on GitHub, with over 152,000 stars, behind freeCodeCamp (over 328,000 stars), Vue.js framework, React library, TensorFlow and others.</p>
            <h2>Bootstrap History</h2>
            <p>Originally released on August 19, 2011, we’ve since had over twenty releases, including two major rewrites with v2 and v3. With Bootstrap 2, we added responsive functionality to the entire framework as an optional stylesheet. Building on that with Bootstrap 3, we rewrote the library once more to make it responsive by default with a mobile first approach.</p>
            <p>Bootstrap 5 was officially released on May 5, 2021</p>
            <h4>Major changes include:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>New offcanvas menu component</li>
                <li>Removing dependence on jQuery in favor of vanilla JavaScript</li>
                <li>Rewriting the grid to support responsive gutters and columns placed outside of rows</li>
                <li>Migrating the documentation from Jekyll to Hugo</li>
                <li>Dropping support for Internet Explorer</li>
                <li>Moving testing infrastructure from QUnit to Jasmine</li>
                <li>Adding custom set of SVG icons</li>
                <li>Adding CSS custom properties</li>
                <li>Improved API</li>
                <li>Enhanced grid system</li>
                <li>Improved customizing docs</li>
                <li>Updated forms</li>
                <li>RTL support</li>

            <h2>What is jQuery?</h2>
            <p>jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.</p>

            <p>The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.</p>
                
            <p>jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.</p>
            <p>The jQuery library contains the following features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML/DOM manipulation</li>
                <li>CSS manipulation</li>
                <li>HTML event methods</li>
                <li>Effects and animations</li>
                <li>AJAX</li>
                <li>Utilities</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Why jQuery?</h2>
            <p>There are lots of other JavaScript libraries out there, but jQuery is probably the most popular, and also the most extendable.</p>

            <header>SASS</header>
            <h2>SASS basics</h2>
            <p>Before you can use Sass, you need to set it up on your project. If you want to just browse here, go ahead, but we recommend you go install Sass first. Go here if you want to learn how to get everything set up.</p>
            <h2>Preprocessing</h2>
            <p>CSS on its own can be fun, but stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a preprocessor can help. Sass has features that don't exist in CSS yet like nesting, mixins, inheritance, and other nifty goodies that help you write robust, maintainable CSS.</p>
            <p>Once you start tinkering with Sass, it will take your preprocessed Sass file and save it as a normal CSS file that you can use in your website.</p>
            <p>The most direct way to make this happen is in your terminal. Once Sass is installed, you can compile your Sass to CSS using the <code>sass</code> command. You'll need to tell Sass which file to build from, and where to output CSS to. For example, running <code>sass input.scss output.css</code>  from your terminal would take a single Sass file, input.scss, and compile that file to output.css.</p>
            <pre>
                <code>sass --watch input.scss output.css</code>
